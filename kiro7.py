# interview_orchestrator.py
# Merged and patched interview orchestrator per your final choices.
# - Keeps your orchestration logic unchanged (Option A).
# - Adds safer, human-like output normalization.
# - Uses a separate Gemini Analyzer + separate Gemini Scorer.
# - Treats 2 consecutive HESITATION_SIGNAL as KNOWLEDGE_GAP (mercy pivot).
# - Momentum normalization_divisor and weight are configurable; defaults tuned below.
# - Analyzer prompt now gets the last 1-2 assistant questions to help avoid repetition.
# - Gemini Expert / Pivot prompts forbids robotic pivot phrases and semicolons and allows a 2-sentence output:
#     sentence 1 = short transition (3-10 words)
#     sentence 2 = concise factual question (<=20 words)
#
# KEY CHANGE (this file): pivot logic now requires 2 consecutive STRONG_NEGATIVE momentum detections
# (a "grace window") before forcing an early pivot. This is implemented via self.pivot_grace_counter.

PROMPT_ANALYZER = """
You are an expert interview judge and strategist. Your job is to analyze the candidate's last answer and provide a JSON-ONLY response to guide the next step.

**Context**
Question: {question}
Answer: {answer}
Recent_Assistant_Questions: {recent_questions_json}

====================================================
STRICT ANSWER CLASSIFICATION RULES (MATCH SYSTEM LOGIC)
====================================================

Before choosing `answer_type`, apply these exact rules:

1. HESITATION_SIGNAL (Highest Priority – Overrides ALL others)
- If the answer contains hesitation tokens: "umm", "uh", "uhh", "hmm", "er", "ah", "...", "uhm"
- OR includes trailing-off / half-sentences like "it works when the signal..."
- OR contains fewer than 3 meaningful words (ignore common fillers like "like", "sure", "okay", "well").

→ answer_type = HESITATION_SIGNAL

2. KNOWLEDGE_GAP (Only if user explicitly expresses not knowing)
- If the user writes "idk", "I don't know", "not sure", "pata nhi", "no idea", "haven't read", etc.
→ answer_type = KNOWLEDGE_GAP

3. EVASIVE_NON_ANSWER
- If user avoids answering without admitting ignorance: e.g., "can you rephrase?", "sure", "okay", "yes", "hmm", "I'll answer", "trying to think"
→ answer_type = EVASIVE_NON_ANSWER

4. EVASIVE_CHALLENGE
- If user challenges the interviewer: e.g., "stupid question", "you tell", "this is pointless", "chup kar"
→ answer_type = EVASIVE_CHALLENGE

5. FACTUALLY_INCORRECT
- If the content is confidently stated but factually wrong for the topic.
→ answer_type = FACTUALLY_INCORRECT

6. VAGUE
- On-topic, >3 meaningful words, not factually wrong, but missing core details.
→ answer_type = VAGUE

7. NORMAL
- Reasonably correct, enough detail, not hesitant, vague, or wrong.
→ answer_type = NORMAL

NOTE: The analyzer should provide a textual advisory score for human inspection only, but this orchestrator will IGNORE any numeric value from the analyzer and rely on a dedicated numeric scorer for decisions.

FOLLOW-UP QUESTION GUIDELINES:
- Your `strategic_question` must follow from the candidate's level, be factual, never repeat the same question,
  and shift to a related sub-concept if the user struggles.
- **Important:** If the proposed `strategic_question` would repeat any of the items in Recent_Assistant_Questions, choose a different, non-repeating strategic_question.

   - When you choose to include feedback, rotate between:
   - brief affirmations ("Alright", "Got it", "Makes sense")
   - soft redirects ("Okay, let’s explore further", "Alright, another angle")
   - neutral transitions ("Sure", "Alright then")
